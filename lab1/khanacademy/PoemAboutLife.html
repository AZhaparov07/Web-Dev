    <h1>Poem about my life</h1>
    <p>Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got. <br>
        Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock. <br>
        Always gon' be a girl that's badder out there on the tours <br>
        But you ain't never gon' be happy 'til you love yours.
    </p>
