<!-- HTML Links - Hyperlinks
HTML links are hyperlinks. -->

<!-- HTML Links - Syntax
The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax: -->
<a href="url">link text</a>
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>
<!-- By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
    An unvisited link is underlined and blue
    A visited link is underlined and purple
    An active link is underlined and red -->

<!-- HTML Links - The target Attribute
The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

The target attribute can have one of the following values:
_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window -->

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a>

<!-- Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs
Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.

A local link (a link to a page within the same website) 
is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part): -->
<h2>Absolute URLs</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></p>

<h2>Relative URLs</h2>

<p><a href="/css/default.asp">CSS Tutorial</a></p>

<!-- HTML Links - Use an Image as a Link
To use an image as a link, just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag: -->
<a href="default.asp">
<img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
</a>

<!-- Link to an Email Address
Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email): -->
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>

<!-- Button as a Link
To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code. -->
<button onclick="document.location='default.asp'">HTML Tutorial</button>

<!-- Link Titles
The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element. -->
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" title="Go to W3Schools HTML section">Visit our HTML Tutorial</a>

<!-- Link Buttons
A link can also be styled as a button, by using CSS: -->
<style>
a:link, a:visited {
  background-color: #f44336;
  color: white;
  padding: 15px 25px;
  text-align: center;
  text-decoration: none;
  display: inline-block;
}

a:hover, a:active {
  background-color: red;
}
</style>

<!-- Create a Bookmark in HTML
Bookmarks can be useful if a web page is very long.

To create a bookmark - first create the bookmark, then add a link to it.

When the link is clicked, the page will scroll down or up to the location with the bookmark. -->
<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>
<a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
