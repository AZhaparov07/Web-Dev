<!-- Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element. -->
<!-- Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

The <p> element is a block-level element.

The <div> element is a block-level element. -->
<p>Hello World</p>
<div>Hello World</div>

<!-- Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary. -->
<span>Hello World</span>

<!-- The <div> Element
The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common. -->

<!-- The <span> Element
The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common. -->
